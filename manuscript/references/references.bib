   abstract = {A priority of nutrition science is to identify dietary determinants of health and disease to inform effective public health policies, guidelines, and clinical interventions. Yet, conflicting findings in synthesizing evidence from randomized trials and observational studies have contributed to confusion and uncertainty. Often, heterogeneity can be explained by the fact that seemingly similar bodies of evidence are asking very different questions. Improving the alignment within and between research domains begins with investigators clearly defining their diet and disease questions; however, nutritional exposures are complex and often require a greater degree of specificity. First, dietary data are compositional, meaning a change in a food may imply a compensatory change of other foods. Second, dietary data are multidimensional; that is, the primary components (ie, foods) comprise subcomponents (eg, nutrients), and subcomponents can be present in multiple primary components. Third, because diet is a lifelong exposure, the composition of a study population's background diet has implications for the interpretation of the exposure and the transportability of effect estimates. Collectively clarifying these key aspects of inherently complex dietary exposures when conducting research will facilitate appropriate evidence synthesis, improve certainty of evidence, and improve the ability of these efforts to inform policy and decision-making.},

Compared with no intervention, limiting sugar-sweetened beverages showed a 0.4% (0.0-0.9%) lower risk of lethal (metastatic or fatal) disease and 0.5% (0.1-0.9%) lower risk of fatal disease. Restricting consumption of processed foods showed a 0.4-0.9% higher risk of all prostate cancer outcomes. Estimated risk differences for clinically significant disease were close to null for strategies involving fruits and non-starchy vegetables, whole grains and legumes, red meat, and processed meat, as well as under a joint strategy of physical activity and diet. Compared with a "low adherence" strategy, maintaining recommended physical activity levels showed a 0.4% (0.1-0.8%) lower risk of lethal and 0.5% (0.2-0.8%) lower risk of fatal disease. Adhering to specific components of current physical activity and dietary recommendations may help to prevent lethal and fatal prostate cancer over 26 years.},

Older adults have increased needs for certain nutrients and nutrient density; the extent to which adherence to CFG recommendations can help reduce inadequate nutrient intakes is unknown. OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to assess the relationship between adherence to CFG recommendations on healthy food choices and intake of key nutrients in adults 65 years and older from the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2015 - Nutrition. METHODS: Secondary analysis of data from 4,093 older adults of the CCHS 2015 - Nutrition (mean age, 73.6 years, 54% females). Dietary intakes were measured using an interviewer-administered 24-hour dietary recall including one repeat in a subsample (42%). The National Cancer Institute multivariate method was used to estimate usual (i.e., long-term) dietary intakes. Adherence to CFG recommendations was measured using the Healthy Eating Food Index (HEFI)-2019 score. Simple linear and logistic regression models estimated the effect of increased HEFI-2019 score on usual nutrient intakes and the prevalence of inadequate nutrient intakes (i.e., below the estimated average requirements), respectively. RESULTS: Compared with the prevalence of inadequate intakes at median HEFI-2019 score (46.4/80 points), a higher HEFI-2019 (+11 points) was associated with reductions in the prevalence of inadequate intakes of magnesium, vitamin B6, and protein (-19.8% [95%CI: -30.8, -8.9], -12.7% [95%CI: -22.5, -3.0], and -4.7% [95%CI: -9.4, -0.1], respectively). In contrast, data for higher HEFI-2019 scores were compatible with increased prevalence of inadequate intakes of folate, vitamin D, and calcium (4.0% [95%CI: -8.4, 16.3], 2.6% [95%CI: 1.1, 4.0], and 2.3% [95%CI: -3.0, 7.5], respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Based on dietary intakes of Canadian older adults in 2015, increasing the degree of adherence to CFG recommendations on healthy food choices may reduce nutrient intake inadequacy for most key nutrients except folate, vitamin D and calcium.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet has been shown to effectively reduce blood pressure and body weight, but its effectiveness for reducing (cardiovascular) mortality rates has never been assessed in a clinical trial. Causal effects of dietary interventions are difficult to measure, due to practical limitations of randomized controlled diet trials. Target trial emulation can be used to improve causal inference in observational data. The aim of this study was to emulate a target trial assessing the relationship between compliance with the DASH diet and cardiovascular and all-cause mortality risk in patients with established CVD. METHODS: Using data from the Alpha Omega Cohort, we emulated a DASH diet trial in patients with a history of myocardial infarction (MI). Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to balance confounders over DASH-compliant and non-DASH-compliant participants. Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with IPT-weighted Cox models. RESULTS: Of 4365 patients (79% male, median age 69 years, >80% treated with lipid- and blood pressure-lowering medication), 598 were classified as DASH-compliant (compliance score >/=5 out of 9). During a median follow-up of 12.4 years, 2035 deaths occurred of which 903 (44%) were of cardiovascular origin. DASH compliance was not associated with all-cause mortality (HR 0.92, 95%CI 0.0.80-1.06) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 0.90, 95%CI 0.72-1.11). CONCLUSIONS: In an emulated target trial on the DASH diet in the Alpha Omega cohort no relation was found between DASH compliance and risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with a history of MI. The DASH diet's effects may have been modified in this population by concomitant use of blood pressure-lowering medications.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Food insecurity is associated with many aspects of poor health. However, trials of food insecurity interventions typically focus on outcomes of interest to funders, such as healthcare use, cost, or clinical performance metrics, rather than quality of life outcomes that may be prioritized by individuals who experience food insecurity. OBJECTIVE: To emulate a trial of a food insecurity elimination intervention, and quantify its estimated effects on health utility, health-related quality of life, and mental health. DESIGN: Target trial emulation using longitudinal, nationally representative data, from the USA, 2016-2017. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2013 adults in the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey screened positive for food insecurity, representing 32 million individuals. MAIN MEASURES: Food insecurity was assessed using the Adult Food Security Survey Module. The primary outcome was the SF-6D (Short-Form Six Dimension) measure of health utility. Secondary outcomes were mental component score (MCS) and physical component score (PCS) of the Veterans RAND 12-Item Health Survey (a measure of health-related quality of life), Kessler 6 (K6) psychological distress, and Patient Health Questionnaire 2-item (PHQ2) depressive symptoms. KEY RESULTS: We estimated that food insecurity elimination would improve health utility by 80 QALYs per 100,000 person-years, or 0.008 QALYs per person per year (95% CI 0.002 to 0.014, p = 0.005), relative to the status quo. We also estimated that food insecurity elimination would improve mental health (difference in MCS [95% CI]: 0.55 [0.14 to 0.96]), physical health (difference in PCS: 0.44 [0.06 to 0.82]), psychological distress (difference in K6: -0.30 [-0.51 to -0.09]), and depressive symptoms (difference in PHQ-2: -0.13 [-0.20 to -0.07]). CONCLUSIONS: Food insecurity elimination may improve important, but understudied, aspects of health. Evaluations of food insecurity interventions should holistically investigate their potential to improve many different aspects of health.},

Follow-up questionnaires were sent in 2008-2009. Incidence of heart failure was ascertained using the Swedish Patient Register updated until 31 December 2019. The parametric g-formula was used to estimate the 22-year risk of heart failure under sustained adherence to a population-adapted DASH diet compared to no intervention. Intakes before 1997 for pre-baseline adjustment was only available in women. In total, 31,238 women and 34,939 men were eligible.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 2019 Canada's Food Guide (CFG) recommends that foods containing mostly unsaturated fatty acid (UFA) should replace foods that contain mostly SFA to reduce SFA intakes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to model the theoretical changes in intake of SFA at the population level if all Canadians adhered to that recommendation. METHODS: Dietary intakes from 24-h recalls in the nationally representative 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition were used for these analyses. Foods identified as high in SFA based on Health Canada's criteria [>/=2 g SFA per reference amount and/or >/=15% of energy (%E) of the food's content as SFA] were replaced by an equal amount (gram per gram) of substitution foods that were lower in SFA and had a higher UFA to SFA ratio. Distributions of SFA and other nutrients before and after substitutions were estimated using the National Cancer Institute (NCI) method based on dietary intakes data from a 24-h recall repeated in 37% of the population. RESULTS: The mean (95% CI) dietary SFA intake among Canadians 2 y or older would be theoretically reduced from 10.8%E (10.7, 11.0%E) to 5.8%E (5.7, 5.9%E) if all high-SFA foods consumed were replaced by the corresponding low-SFA/high-UFA foods. Modeled usual intake of SFA after substitution was <10%E in 100% of Canadians, irrespective of sex and age. Almost half (44%) of the modeled reduction in SFA intake was attributed to replacement of SFA-rich foods not recommended in the 2019 CFG. CONCLUSIONS: This food-based substitution modeling analysis suggests that consumption of SFA would be below 10%E in Canada if all Canadians adhered to the 2019 CFG recommendation that foods containing mostly UFA should replace foods that contain mostly SFA.},

This study describes the development and scoring standards of the Healthy Eating Food Index (HEFI)-2019, which is intended to measure alignment of eating patterns with CFG-2019 recommendations on food choices among Canadians aged 2 years and older. Alignment with the intent of each key recommendation in the CFG-2019 was the primary principle guiding the development of the HEFI-2019. Additional considerations included previously published indices, data on Canadians' dietary intakes from the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) - Nutrition, and expert judgement. The HEFI-2019 includes 10 components: Vegetables and fruits (20 points), Whole-grain foods (5 points), Grain foods ratio (5 points), Protein foods (5 points), Plant-based protein foods (5 points), Beverages (10 points), Fatty acids ratio (5 points), Saturated fats (5 points), Free sugars (10 points), and Sodium (10 points). All components are expressed as ratios (e.g., proportions of total foods, total beverages, or total energy). The HEFI-2019 score has a maximum of 80 points. Potential uses of the HEFI-2019 include research as well as monitoring and surveillance of food choices in population-based surveys.},

Dietary intake data from 24-hour dietary recalls in the 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey - Nutrition were used for that purpose. Multidimensionality was examined using principal component analysis. Mean scores were compared among subgroups of the population. The association between scores and energy intake was assessed using Pearson correlations. Cronbach's alpha was calculated to assess reliability. The estimated mean HEFI-2019 score (/80) was 43.1 (95%CI, 42.7 to 43.6) among Canadians 2 years and older. The first and 99th percentiles were 22.1 and 62.9 points. The mean HEFI-2019 score for smokers was 7.1 points lower than for non-smokers (95%CI, -8.4 to -5.8). The HEFI-2019 was weakly correlated with energy intake (r=-0.13; 95%CI, -0.20 to -0.06). The principal components analysis revealed at least 4 dimensions. Cronbach's alpha was 0.66 (95%CI, 0.63 to 0.69). Evidence of construct validity and internal consistency support the use of the HEFI-2019 to assess adherence to CFG-2019's recommendations on healthy food choices.},

   abstract = {Background: The Canada's Food Guide (CFG) was profoundly revised in 2019, but the extent to which adherence to recommendations on healthy food choices reduces the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) is unknown.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to examine how greater adherence to the 2019 CFG's recommendations on healthy food choices influences the risk of incident CVD.

Design: Participants were a sample of adults without history of CVD, diabetes or cancer from the UK Biobank prospective cohort study. Usual dietary intakes were estimated by modeling data from repeated web-based 24-h dietary recalls using the National Cancer Institute multivariate method. Adherence to key CFG's recommendations on healthy food choices was assessed using the Healthy Eating Food Index (HEFI)-2019. The CVD outcome was a composite of fatal and non-fatal myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke. Cox regression models adjusted via inverse probability weighting were used to estimate CVD risks. Counterfactual models were used to interpret risks of hypothetical changes in the HEFI-2019 score.

Results: A total of 136,698 participants met the eligibility criteria (55% females, mean age of 57.2 years, range 40-75 years). During the 11-year follow-up, there were 2,843 cases of incident CVD. Compared with no change in the HEFI-2019 score, increasing the HEFI-2019 score of all participants to the 90th percentile of the score distribution (58.1 points) would hypothetically reduce the risk of CVD by 24% (relative risk, 0.76; 95%CI: 0.58, 0.94; absolute risk difference, -0.58%).

Conclusions: These results suggest that greater adherence to the 2019 CFG recommendations on healthy food choices reduces the 11-year risk of CVD in middle-aged and older adults.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Four models are commonly used to adjust for energy intake when estimating the causal effect of a dietary component on an outcome: 1) the "standard model" adjusts for total energy intake, 2) the "energy partition model" adjusts forremaining energy intake, 3) the "nutrient density model" rescales the exposure as a proportion of total energy, and 4) the "residual model" indirectly adjusts for total energy by using a residual. It remains underappreciated that each approach evaluates a different estimand and only partially accounts for confounding by common dietary causes. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to clarify the implied causal estimand and interpretation of each model and evaluate their performance in reducing dietary confounding. METHODS: Semiparametric directed acyclic graphs and Monte Carlo simulations were used to identify the estimands and interpretations implied by each model and explore their performance in the absence or presence of dietary confounding. RESULTS: The "standard model" and the mathematically identical "residual model" estimate the average relative causal effect (i.e., a "substitution" effect) but provide biased estimates even in the absence of confounding. The "energy partition model" estimates the total causal effect but only provides unbiased estimates in the absence of confounding or when all other nutrients have equal effects on the outcome. The "nutrient density model" has an obscure interpretation but attempts to estimate the average relative causal effect rescaled as a proportion of total energy. Accurate estimates of both the total and average relative causal effects may instead be derived by simultaneously adjusting for all dietary components, an approach we term the "all-components model." CONCLUSIONS: Lack of awareness of the estimand differences and accuracy of the 4 modeling approaches may explain some of the apparent heterogeneity among existing nutritional studies. This raises serious questions regarding the validity of meta-analyses where different estimands have been inappropriately pooled.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Estimating relative causal effects (i.e., "substitution effects") is a common aim of nutritional research. In observational data, this is usually attempted using 1 of 2 statistical modeling approaches: the leave-one-out model and the energy partition model. Despite their widespread use, there are concerns that neither approach is well understood in practice. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to explore and illustrate the theory and performance of the leave-one-out and energy partition models for estimating substitution effects in nutritional epidemiology. METHODS: Monte Carlo data simulations were used to illustrate the theory and performance of both the leave-one-out model and energy partition model, by considering 3 broad types of causal effect estimands: 1) direct substitutions of the exposure with a single component, 2) inadvertent substitutions of the exposure with several components, and 3) average relative causal effects of the exposure instead of all other dietary sources. Models containing macronutrients, foods measured in calories, and foods measured in grams were all examined. RESULTS: The leave-one-out and energy partition models both performed equally well when the target estimand involved substituting a single exposure with a single component, provided all variables were measured in the same units. Bias occurred when the substitution involved >1 substituting component. Leave-one-out models that examined foods in mass while adjusting for total energy intake evaluated obscure estimands. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of the approach, substitution models need to be constructed from clearly defined causal effect estimands. Estimands involving a single exposure and a single substituting component are typically estimated more accurately than estimands involving more complex substitutions. The practice of examining foods measured in grams or portions while adjusting for total energy intake is likely to deliver obscure relative effect estimands with unclear interpretations.},

As a case study, we consider recent findings that suggest human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is less effective against HPV-associated disease among girls living with HIV compared to girls without HIV. OBJECTIVES: To understand the relationship between HIV status and HPV vaccine effectiveness, it is important to outline the key assumptions of the causal mechanisms before designing a study to investigate the effect of the HPV vaccine in girls living with HIV infection. METHODS: We present a causal graph to describe our assumptions and proposed approach to explore this relationship. We hope to obtain feedback on our assumptions prior to data analysis and exemplify the process for designing causal graphs to inform an etiologic study. CONCLUSION: The approach we lay out in this paper may be useful for other researchers who have an interest in using causal graphs to describe and assess assumptions in their own research prior to undergoing data collection and/or analysis.},

OBJECTIVES: We describe a methodological approach that aims to emulate a target trial of dietary interventions sustained over many years using data from observational cohort studies. METHODS: We estimated the 20-y risk of all-cause mortality under the sustained implementation of the food-based goals of the American Heart Association (AHA) 2020 using data from 3 prospective observational studies of US men [Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS)] and women [Nurses' Health Study (NHS) and Nurses' Health Study II (NHS II)]. We applied the parametric g-formula to estimate the 20-y mortality risk under a dietary intervention and under no dietary intervention. RESULTS: There were 165,411 participants who met the eligibility criteria. The mean age at baseline was 57.4 y (range, 43-82 y) in the HPFS, 52.4 y (range, 39-66 y) in the NHS, and 40.2 y (range, 30-50 y) in the NHS II. During 20 y of follow-up, 13,241 participants died. The estimated 20-y mortality risks under a dietary intervention versus no intervention were 21.9% compared with 25.8%, respectively, in the HPFS (risk difference, -3.9%; 95% CI: -4.9% to -3.2%); 10.0% compared with 12.6%, respectively, in the NHS (risk difference, -2.6%; 95% CI: -3.1% to -1.8%); and 2.1% compared with 2.5%, respectively, in the NHS II (risk difference, -0.35%; 95% CI: -0.56% to -0.09%). The corresponding risk ratios were 0.85 (95% CI: 0.81-0.88) in the HPFS, 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75-0.85) in the NHS, and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.78-0.96) in the NHS II. CONCLUSIONS: We estimated that adherence to the food-based AHA 2020 Dietary Goals starting in midlife may reduce the 20-y risk of mortality.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The messenger RNA (mRNA)-based vaccines BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 are more than 90% effective against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19). However, their comparative effectiveness for a range of outcomes across diverse populations is unknown. METHODS: We emulated a target trial using the electronic health records of U.S. veterans who received a first dose of the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccine between January 4 and May 14, 2021, during a period marked by predominance of the SARS-CoV-2 B.1.1.7 (alpha) variant. We matched recipients of each vaccine in a 1:1 ratio according to their risk factors. Outcomes included documented severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, symptomatic Covid-19, hospitalization for Covid-19, admission to an intensive care unit (ICU) for Covid-19, and death from Covid-19. We estimated risks using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. To assess the influence of the B.1.617.2 (delta) variant, we emulated a second target trial that involved veterans vaccinated between July 1 and September 20, 2021. RESULTS: Each vaccine group included 219,842 persons. Over 24 weeks of follow-up in a period marked by alpha-variant predominance, the estimated risk of documented infection was 5.75 events per 1000 persons (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.39 to 6.23) in the BNT162b2 group and 4.52 events per 1000 persons (95% CI, 4.17 to 4.84) in the mRNA-1273 group. The excess number of events per 1000 persons for BNT162b2 as compared with mRNA-1273 was 1.23 (95% CI, 0.72 to 1.81) for documented infection, 0.44 (95% CI, 0.25 to 0.70) for symptomatic Covid-19, 0.55 (95% CI, 0.36 to 0.83) for hospitalization for Covid-19, 0.10 (95% CI, 0.00 to 0.26) for ICU admission for Covid-19, and 0.02 (95% CI, -0.06 to 0.12) for death from Covid-19. The corresponding excess risk (BNT162b2 vs. mRNA-1273) of documented infection over 12 weeks of follow-up in a period marked by delta-variant predominance was 6.54 events per 1000 persons (95% CI, -2.58 to 11.82). CONCLUSIONS: The 24-week risk of Covid-19 outcomes was low after vaccination with mRNA-1273 or BNT162b2, although risks were lower with mRNA-1273 than with BNT162b2. This pattern was consistent across periods marked by alpha- and delta-variant predominance. (Funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs and others.).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 2019 Canada's Food Guide recommends the consumption of lower fat dairy products to reduce saturated fat (SFA) intakes. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to assess the impact of such recommendation on SFA intake at a population level in Canada. METHODS: Analyses were conducted based on dietary intakes from the nationally representative 2015 Canadian Community Health Survey-Nutrition (unweighted n = 20,103). Dietary intake was assessed using 24-h dietary recalls. Food-based substitution modeling analyses were conducted by replacing all regular-fat dairy products reported by an equal amount of a corresponding lower fat dairy product. Regular-fat dairy products included milks >/=2% fat, cheeses >25% fat, and yogurts >/=2% fat. Corresponding lower fat replacement products were 1% fat milks, 10-25% fat cheeses, and <2% fat yogurts. The National Cancer Institute method was used to account for within-person variation in dietary intakes. RESULTS: Replacing all regular-fat dairy products consumed by Canadians (ages >/=2 y) by a corresponding lower fat product reduced the population's SFA intake from 10.8% of total energy intake (%E; 95% CI: 10.7%, 11.0%) to 10.0%E (95% CI: 9.8%, 10.2%). This reduction was mostly attributable to the milk and cheese substitutions (mean SFA reductions of -0.3%E each). The proportion of the population with an SFA intake <10%E was 34.7% (95% CI: 31.2%, 38.2%) before substitution and 51.5% (95% CI: 47.5%, 55.5%) after substitution. CONCLUSIONS: This food-based substitution modeling analysis suggests that SFA intakes at a population level are slightly reduced if all regular-fat dairy products consumed by Canadians were replaced by a lower fat dairy product. Approximately half of the population would still consume SFAs in excess of 10%E even if all regular-fat dairy consumed were replaced by lower fat dairy.},

   abstract = {Background and Purpose- Long-term effect of lifestyle changes on stroke incidence has not been estimated in randomized trials. We used observational data to estimate the incidence of stroke under hypothetical lifestyle strategies in the NHS (Nurses' Health Study). Methods- We considered 3 nondietary strategies (smoking cessation, exercising >/=30 min/d, gradual body mass index reduction if overweight/obese) and several dietary strategies (eating >/=3 servings/wk of fish, </=3 servings/wk of unprocessed red meat, no processed red meat, >/=1 servings/d of nuts, etc). We used the parametric g-formula to estimate the 26-year risk of stroke under these strategies. Results- In 59 727 women, mean age 52 years at baseline in 1986, the estimated 26-year risks under no lifestyle interventions were 4.7% for total stroke, 2.4% for ischemic stroke, and 0.7% for hemorrhagic stroke. Under the combined nondietary interventions, the estimated 26-year risk of total stroke was 3.5% (95% CI, 2.6%-4.3%) and ischemic stroke was 1.6% (95% CI, 1.1%-2.1%). Smaller reductions in total stroke risk were estimated under isolated dietary strategies of increased intake of fish and nuts and reduced intake of unprocessed red meat. Ischemic stroke risk was lower under reduced intake of unprocessed and processed red meat, and hemorrhagic stroke risk was lower under a strategy of increased fish consumption. Conclusions- In this population of middle-aged women, sustained, lifestyle modifications were estimated to reduce the 26-year risk of total stroke by 25% and ischemic stroke by 36%. Sustained dietary modifications were estimated to reduce the 26-year risk of total stroke by 23%.},

   abstract = {Measurement error and misclassification of variables frequently occur in epidemiology and involve variables important to public health. Their presence can impact strongly on results of statistical analyses involving such variables. However, investigators commonly fail to pay attention to biases resulting from such mismeasurement. We provide, in two parts, an overview of the types of error that occur, their impacts on analytic results, and statistical methods to mitigate the biases that they cause. In this first part, we review different types of measurement error and misclassification, emphasizing the classical, linear, and Berkson models, and on the concepts of nondifferential and differential error. We describe the impacts of these types of error in covariates and in outcome variables on various analyses, including estimation and testing in regression models and estimating distributions. We outline types of ancillary studies required to provide information about such errors and discuss the implications of covariate measurement error for study design. Methods for ascertaining sample size requirements are outlined, both for ancillary studies designed to provide information about measurement error and for main studies where the exposure of interest is measured with error. We describe two of the simpler methods, regression calibration and simulation extrapolation (SIMEX), that adjust for bias in regression coefficients caused by measurement error in continuous covariates, and illustrate their use through examples drawn from the Observing Protein and Energy (OPEN) dietary validation study. Finally, we review software available for implementing these methods. The second part of the article deals with more advanced topics.},

   abstract = {The survival impact of adhering to current physical activity guidelines after prostate cancer diagnosis is unknown. We therefore emulated a target trial of guideline-based physical activity interventions and 10-year survival among US men with nonmetastatic prostate cancer. We used observational data on 2,299 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study who were diagnosed with nonmetastatic prostate cancer from 1998 to 2010 and were free of conditions that might have precluded participation at baseline (first postdiagnostic questionnaire). We estimated their survival under several guideline-based physical activity interventions starting at baseline and ending at the development of conditions limiting physical ability. We adjusted for baseline and time-varying risk factors for death using the parametric g-formula. Compared with the observed 15.4% mortality risk, the estimated 10-year risks of mortality were 13.0% (95% confidence interval (CI): 10.9, 15.4) and 11.1% (95% CI: 8.7, 14.1) for >/=1.25 hours/week and >/=2.5 hours/week of vigorous activity, respectively, and 13.9% (95% CI: 12.0, 16.0) and 12.6% (95% CI: 10.6, 14.7) for >/=2.5 hours/week and >/=5 hours/week of moderate activity, respectively. We estimated that these men would have experienced clinically meaningful reductions in mortality had they followed current physical activity recommendations until the development of conditions limiting physical ability. These findings may help guide clinical recommendations for prostate cancer patients and the design of future randomized trials.},

   abstract = {Researchers are often interested in estimating the causal effects of sustained treatment strategies, i.e., of (hypothetical) interventions involving time-varying treatments. When using observational data, estimating those effects requires adjustment for confounding. However, conventional regression methods cannot appropriately adjust for confounding in the presence of treatment-confounder feedback. In contrast, estimators derived from Robins's g-formula may correctly adjust for confounding even if treatment-confounder feedback exists. The package gfoRmula implements in R one such estimator: the parametric g-formula. This estimator can be used to estimate the effects of binary or continuous time-varying treatments as well as contrasts defined by static or dynamic, deterministic, or random interventions, as well as interventions that depend on the natural value of treatment. The package accommodates survival outcomes as well as binary or continuous outcomes measured at the end of follow-up. This paper describes the gfoRmula package, along with motivating background, features, and examples.},

   abstract = {Correct specification of the exposure model is essential for unbiased estimation in marginal structural models with inverse-probability-of-treatment weights. However, although flexible modeling is commonplace when estimating effects of continuous covariates in outcome models, its use is less frequent in estimation of inverse probability weights. Using simulations, we assess the accuracy of the treatment effect estimates and covariate balance obtained with different exposure model specifications when the true relationship between a continuous, possibly time-varying covariate Lt and the logit of the probability of exposure is nonlinear. Specifically, we compare 4 approaches to modeling the effect of Lt when estimating inverse probability weights: a linear function, the covariate-balancing propensity score, and 2 easy-to-implement flexible methods that relax the assumption of linearity: cubic regression splines and fractional polynomials. Using data from 2 empirical studies, we compare linear exposure models with flexible exposure models to estimate the effect of sustained virological response to hepatitis C virus treatment on the progression of liver fibrosis. Our simulation results demonstrate that ignoring important nonlinear relationships when fitting the exposure model may provide poorer covariate balance and induce substantial bias in the estimated exposure-outcome associations. Analysts should routinely consider flexible modeling of continuous covariates when estimating inverse-probability-of-treatment weights.},

His work explains how we can know easy things, like whether it was rain or a sprinkler that made a sidewalk wet; and how to answer hard questions, like whether a drug cured an illness. Pearl's work enables us to know not just whether one thing causes another: it lets us explore the world that is and the worlds that could have been.

   abstract = {A projected doubling in the global population of people aged >/=60 y by the year 2050 has major health and economic implications, especially in developing regions. Burdens of unhealthy aging associated with chronic noncommunicable and other age-related diseases may be largely preventable with lifestyle modification, including diet. However, as adults age they become at risk of "nutritional frailty," which can compromise their ability to meet nutritional requirements at a time when specific nutrient needs may be high. This review highlights the role of nutrition science in promoting healthy aging and in improving the prognosis in cases of age-related diseases. It serves to identify key knowledge gaps and implementation challenges to support adequate nutrition for healthy aging, including applicability of metrics used in body-composition and diet adequacy for older adults and mechanisms to reduce nutritional frailty and to promote diet resilience. This review also discusses management recommendations for several leading chronic conditions common in aging populations, including cognitive decline and dementia, sarcopenia, and compromised immunity to infectious disease. The role of health systems in incorporating nutrition care routinely for those aged >/=60 y and living independently and current actions to address nutritional status before hospitalization and the development of disease are discussed.},

Higher body mass index was related to underreporting of sodium. Calibration equations for true intake that included personal characteristics provided improved prediction, except for sodium density.

   abstract = {We pooled data from 5 large validation studies of dietary self-report instruments that used recovery biomarkers as references to clarify the measurement properties of food frequency questionnaires (FFQs) and 24-hour recalls. The studies were conducted in widely differing US adult populations from 1999 to 2009. We report on total energy, protein, and protein density intakes. Results were similar across sexes, but there was heterogeneity across studies. Using a FFQ, the average correlation coefficients for reported versus true intakes for energy, protein, and protein density were 0.21, 0.29, and 0.41, respectively. Using a single 24-hour recall, the coefficients were 0.26, 0.40, and 0.36, respectively, for the same nutrients and rose to 0.31, 0.49, and 0.46 when three 24-hour recalls were averaged. The average rate of under-reporting of energy intake was 28% with a FFQ and 15% with a single 24-hour recall, but the percentages were lower for protein. Personal characteristics related to under-reporting were body mass index, educational level, and age. Calibration equations for true intake that included personal characteristics provided improved prediction. This project establishes that FFQs have stronger correlations with truth for protein density than for absolute protein intake, that the use of multiple 24-hour recalls substantially increases the correlations when compared with a single 24-hour recall, and that body mass index strongly predicts under-reporting of energy and protein intakes.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Physical inactivity, inadequate dietary protein, and low-grade systemic inflammation contribute to age-related muscle loss, impaired function, and disability. OBJECTIVE: We assessed the effects of progressive resistance training (PRT) combined with a protein-enriched diet facilitated through lean red meat on lean tissue mass (LTM), muscle size, strength and function, circulating inflammatory markers, blood pressure, and lipids in elderly women. DESIGN: In a 4-mo cluster randomized controlled trial, 100 women aged 60-90 y who were residing in 15 retirement villages were allocated to receive PRT with lean red meat ( approximately 160 g cooked) to be consumed 6 d/wk [resistance training plus lean red meat (RT+Meat) group; n = 53] or control PRT [1 serving pasta or rice/d; control resistance training (CRT) group; n = 47)]. All women undertook PRT 2 times/wk and received 1000 IU vitamin D3/d. RESULTS: The mean (+/- SD) protein intake was greater in the RT+Meat group than in the CRT group throughout the study (1.3 +/- 0.3 compared with 1.1 +/- 0.3 g . kg(-)(1) . d(-)(1), respectively; P < 0.05). The RT+Meat group experienced greater gains in total body LTM (0.45 kg; 95% CI: 0.07, 0.84 kg), leg LTM (0.22 kg; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.42 kg), and muscle strength (18%; 95% CI: 0.03, 0.34) than did the CRT group (all P < 0.05). The RT+Meat group also experienced a 10% greater increase in serum insulin-like growth factor I (P < 0.05) and a 16% greater reduction in the proinflammatory marker interleukin-6 (IL-6) (P < 0.05) after 4 mo. There were no between-group differences for the change in blood lipids or blood pressure. CONCLUSION: A protein-enriched diet equivalent to approximately 1.3 g . kg(-)(1) . d(-)(1) achieved through lean red meat is safe and effective for enhancing the effects of PRT on LTM and muscle strength and reducing circulating IL-6 concentrations in elderly women. This trial was registered at the Australian Clinical Trials Registry as ACTRN12609000223235.},

   abstract = {Our understanding of the potential benefits and challenges of optimizing dietary protein intake in older adults continues to evolve. An overarching hypothesis generated during Protein Summit 2.0 was that consuming an adequate amount of high-quality protein at each meal, in combination with physical activity, may delay the onset of sarcopenia, slow its progression, reduce the magnitude of its functional consequences, or all of these. The potential benefits of young and middle-aged adults adopting a diet pattern whereby adequate protein is consumed at each meal as a countermeasure to sarcopenia are presented and discussed. For example, meeting a protein threshold ( approximately 25-30 g/meal) represents a promising, yet still largely unexplored dietary strategy to help maintain muscle mass and function. For many older adults, breakfast is a carbohydrate-dominated lower-protein meal and represents an opportunity to improve and more evenly distribute daily protein intake. Although both animal and plant-based proteins can provide the required essential amino acids for health, animal proteins generally have a higher proportion of the amino acid leucine. Leucine plays a key role in stimulating translation initiation and muscle protein anabolism and is the focus of ongoing research. Protein requirements should be assessed in the light of habitual physical activity. An evenly distributed protein diet provides a framework that allows older adults to benefit from the synergistic anabolic effect of protein and physical activity. To fully understand the role of dietary protein intake in healthy aging, greater efforts are needed to coordinate and integrate research design and data acquisition and interpretation from a variety of disciplines.},

   abstract = {The aging process is associated with gradual and progressive loss of muscle mass along with lowered strength and physical endurance. This condition, sarcopenia, has been widely observed with aging in sedentary adults. Regular aerobic and resistance exercise programs have been shown to counteract most aspects of sarcopenia. In addition, good nutrition, especially adequate protein and energy intake, can help limit and treat age-related declines in muscle mass, strength, and functional abilities. Protein nutrition in combination with exercise is considered optimal for maintaining muscle function. With the goal of providing recommendations for health care professionals to help older adults sustain muscle strength and function into older age, the European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN) hosted a Workshop on Protein Requirements in the Elderly, held in Dubrovnik on November 24 and 25, 2013. Based on the evidence presented and discussed, the following recommendations are made (a) for healthy older people, the diet should provide at least 1.0-1.2 g protein/kg body weight/day, (b) for older people who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition because they have acute or chronic illness, the diet should provide 1.2-1.5 g protein/kg body weight/day, with even higher intake for individuals with severe illness or injury, and (c) daily physical activity or exercise (resistance training, aerobic exercise) should be undertaken by all older people, for as long as possible.},

   abstract = {New evidence shows that older adults need more dietary protein than do younger adults to support good health, promote recovery from illness, and maintain functionality. Older people need to make up for age-related changes in protein metabolism, such as high splanchnic extraction and declining anabolic responses to ingested protein. They also need more protein to offset inflammatory and catabolic conditions associated with chronic and acute diseases that occur commonly with aging. With the goal of developing updated, evidence-based recommendations for optimal protein intake by older people, the European Union Geriatric Medicine Society (EUGMS), in cooperation with other scientific organizations, appointed an international study group to review dietary protein needs with aging (PROT-AGE Study Group). To help older people (>65 years) maintain and regain lean body mass and function, the PROT-AGE study group recommends average daily intake at least in the range of 1.0 to 1.2 g protein per kilogram of body weight per day. Both endurance- and resistance-type exercises are recommended at individualized levels that are safe and tolerated, and higher protein intake (ie, >/= 1.2 g/kg body weight/d) is advised for those who are exercising and otherwise active. Most older adults who have acute or chronic diseases need even more dietary protein (ie, 1.2-1.5 g/kg body weight/d). Older people with severe kidney disease (ie, estimated GFR <30 mL/min/1.73 m(2)), but who are not on dialysis, are an exception to this rule; these individuals may need to limit protein intake. Protein quality, timing of ingestion, and intake of other nutritional supplements may be relevant, but evidence is not yet sufficient to support specific recommendations. Older people are vulnerable to losses in physical function capacity, and such losses predict loss of independence, falls, and even mortality. Thus, future studies aimed at pinpointing optimal protein intake in specific populations of older people need to include measures of physical function.},

   abstract = {In the United States the preferred method of obtaining dietary intake data is the 24-hour dietary recall, yet the measure of most interest is usual or long-term average daily intake, which is impossible to measure. Thus, usual dietary intake is assessed with considerable measurement error. Also, diet represents numerous foods, nutrients and other components, each of which have distinctive attributes. Sometimes, it is useful to examine intake of these components separately, but increasingly nutritionists are interested in exploring them collectively to capture overall dietary patterns. Consumption of these components varies widely: some are consumed daily by almost everyone on every day, while others are episodically consumed so that 24-hour recall data are zero-inflated. In addition, they are often correlated with each other. Finally, it is often preferable to analyze the amount of a dietary component relative to the amount of energy (calories) in a diet because dietary recommendations often vary with energy level. The quest to understand overall dietary patterns of usual intake has to this point reached a standstill. There are no statistical methods or models available to model such complex multivariate data with its measurement error and zero inflation. This paper proposes the first such model, and it proposes the first workable solution to fit such a model. After describing the model, we use survey-weighted MCMC computations to fit the model, with uncertainty estimation coming from balanced repeated replication.The methodology is illustrated through an application to estimating the population distribution of the Healthy Eating Index-2005 (HEI-2005), a multi-component dietary quality index involving ratios of interrelated dietary components to energy, among children aged 2-8 in the United States. We pose a number of interesting questions about the HEI-2005 and provide answers that were not previously within the realm of possibility, and we indicate ways that our approach can be used to answer other questions of importance to nutritional science and public health.},

The 5-year longitudinal study, NuAge, was designed to assess the pivotal role of nutrition on physical and cognitive status, functional autonomy and social functioning. A cohort of 1793 men and women, selected from three age groups (68-72, 73-77, 78-82) at recruitment, has been followed annually since 2003-2004. A plurimethodological approach, including basic, clinical, epidemiologic, and social research has been used. Data on various facets of nutritional status (diet, food habits, appetite, anthropometry and body composition), and functional (muscle strength, physical activity, physical and functional capacities and performance), medical (physical, mental and cognitive health, medication) and social data (network, support, participation) are collected by questionnaires or direct measurements. Blood, urine, and saliva samples are also collected and processed for genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and biochemical analyses and to study markers of endocrine, immune, and cognitive functions. Selected bio-psycho-social characteristics of the cohort, consumption of macronutrients, and biologic variables are presented, including the impact of intake of certain foods on total antioxidant status. Understanding the aging process as regulated by a modifiable factor such as nutrition should facilitate the development of targeted strategies for promoting successful aging.},

   abstract = {Concerns about reverse causality and selection bias complicate the interpretation of studies of body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2) and mortality in older adults. The objective of this study was to investigate methodological explanations for the apparent attenuation of obesity-related risks in older adults. We used data from 68,132 participants in the Women's Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial for this analysis. All of the participants were postmenopausal women aged 50-79 years at baseline (1993-1998). To examine reverse causality and selective attrition, we compared rate ratios from inverse probability of treatment- and censoring-weighted Poisson marginal structural models with results from an unweighted adjusted Poisson regression model. The estimated mortality rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals for BMIs of 30.0-34.9, 35.0-39.9 and >/=40.0 were 0.86 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.77, 0.96), 0.85 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.99), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.72, 1.07), respectively, in the unweighted model. The corresponding mortality rate ratios were 0.96 (95% CI: 0.86, 1.07), 1.12 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.29), and 1.31 95% CI: (1.08, 1.57), respectively, in the marginal structural model. Results from the inverse probability of treatment- and censoring-weighted marginal structural model were attenuated in low BMI categories and increased in high BMI categories. The results demonstrate the importance of accounting for reverse causality and selective attrition in studies of older adults.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To discuss possible explanations for the obesity paradox and explore whether the paradox can be attributed to a form of selection bias known as collider stratification bias. METHOD: The paper is divided into three parts. First, possible explanations for the obesity paradox are reviewed. Second, a simulated example is provided to describe collider stratification bias and how it could generate the obesity paradox. Finally, an example is provided using data from 17,636 participants in the US National and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Generalized linear models were fit to assess the effect of obesity on mortality both in the general population and among individuals with diagnosed cardiovascular disease (CVD). Additionally, results from a bias analysis are presented. RESULTS: In the general population, the adjusted risk ratio relating obesity and all-cause mortality was 1.24 (95% CI 1.11, 1.39). Adjusted risk ratios comparing obese and non-obese among individuals with and without CVD were 0.79 (95% CI 0.68, 0.91) and 1.30 (95% CI=1.12, 1.50), indicating that obesity has a protective association among individuals with CVD. CONCLUSION: Results demonstrate that collider stratification bias is one plausible explanation for the obesity paradox. After conditioning on CVD status in the design or analysis, obesity can appear protective among individuals with CVD.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: As mass vaccination campaigns against coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) commence worldwide, vaccine effectiveness needs to be assessed for a range of outcomes across diverse populations in a noncontrolled setting. In this study, data from Israel's largest health care organization were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine. METHODS: All persons who were newly vaccinated during the period from December 20, 2020, to February 1, 2021, were matched to unvaccinated controls in a 1:1 ratio according to demographic and clinical characteristics. Study outcomes included documented infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), symptomatic Covid-19, Covid-19-related hospitalization, severe illness, and death. We estimated vaccine effectiveness for each outcome as one minus the risk ratio, using the Kaplan-Meier estimator. RESULTS: Each study group included 596,618 persons. Estimated vaccine effectiveness for the study outcomes at days 14 through 20 after the first dose and at 7 or more days after the second dose was as follows: for documented infection, 46% (95% confidence interval [CI], 40 to 51) and 92% (95% CI, 88 to 95); for symptomatic Covid-19, 57% (95% CI, 50 to 63) and 94% (95% CI, 87 to 98); for hospitalization, 74% (95% CI, 56 to 86) and 87% (95% CI, 55 to 100); and for severe disease, 62% (95% CI, 39 to 80) and 92% (95% CI, 75 to 100), respectively. Estimated effectiveness in preventing death from Covid-19 was 72% (95% CI, 19 to 100) for days 14 through 20 after the first dose. Estimated effectiveness in specific subpopulations assessed for documented infection and symptomatic Covid-19 was consistent across age groups, with potentially slightly lower effectiveness in persons with multiple coexisting conditions. CONCLUSIONS: This study in a nationwide mass vaccination setting suggests that the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine is effective for a wide range of Covid-19-related outcomes, a finding consistent with that of the randomized trial.},

   abstract = {Although review papers on causal inference methods are now available, there is a lack of introductory overviews on what they can render and on the guiding criteria for choosing one particular method. This tutorial gives an overview in situations where an exposure of interest is set at a chosen baseline ("point exposure") and the target outcome arises at a later time point. We first phrase relevant causal questions and make a case for being specific about the possible exposure levels involved and the populations for which the question is relevant. Using the potential outcomes framework, we describe principled definitions of causal effects and of estimation approaches classified according to whether they invoke the no unmeasured confounding assumption (including outcome regression and propensity score-based methods) or an instrumental variable with added assumptions. We mainly focus on continuous outcomes and causal average treatment effects. We discuss interpretation, challenges, and potential pitfalls and illustrate application using a "simulation learner," that mimics the effect of various breastfeeding interventions on a child's later development. This involves a typical simulation component with generated exposure, covariate, and outcome data inspired by a randomized intervention study. The simulation learner further generates various (linked) exposure types with a set of possible values per observation unit, from which observed as well as potential outcome data are generated. It thus provides true values of several causal effects. R code for data generation and analysis is available on www.ofcaus.org, where SAS and Stata code for analysis is also provided.},

When we cannot conduct a randomized experiment, we analyze observational data. Causal inference from large observational databases (big data) can be viewed as an attempt to emulate a randomized experiment-the target experiment or target trial-that would answer the question of interest. When the goal is to guide decisions among several strategies, causal analyses of observational data need to be evaluated with respect to how well they emulate a particular target trial. We outline a framework for comparative effectiveness research using big data that makes the target trial explicit. This framework channels counterfactual theory for comparing the effects of sustained treatment strategies, organizes analytic approaches, provides a structured process for the criticism of observational studies, and helps avoid common methodologic pitfalls.},

   abstract = {Background: Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is associated with negative health outcomes in both the short and long term. However, the cohort studies that have produced many of the estimates of long-term exposure associations may fail to account for selection bias in pollution exposure as well as covariate imbalance in the study population; therefore, causal modeling techniques may be beneficial. Methods: Twenty-nine years of data from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) was compiled and linked to modeled annual average outdoor PM2.5 concentration and restricted-use mortality data. A series of Cox proportional hazards models, adjusted using inverse probability weights, yielded causal risk estimates of long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 on all-cause and cardiopulmonary mortality. Results: Covariate-adjusted estimated relative risks per 10 mug/m(3) increase in PM2.5 exposure were estimated to be 1.117 (1.083, 1.152) for all-cause mortality and 1.232 (1.174, 1.292) for cardiopulmonary mortality. Inverse probability weighted Cox models provide relatively consistent and robust estimates similar to those in the unweighted baseline multivariate Cox model, though they have marginally lower point estimates and higher standard errors. Conclusions: These results provide evidence that long-term exposure to PM2.5 contributes to increased mortality risk in US adults and that the estimated effects are generally robust to modeling choices. The size and robustness of estimated associations highlight the importance of clean air as a matter of public health. Estimated confounding due to measured covariates appears minimal in the NHIS cohort, and various distributional assumptions have little bearing on the magnitude or standard errors of estimated causal associations.},

   abstract = {Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are often considered to be the highest quality of evidence owing to the absence of baseline confounding, the simplicity of analyses, and direct estimation of causal effects. However, observational studies can be designed to mimic RCTs and estimate causal treatment effects. In this review, we describe the target trial framework to illustrate how observational studies can successfully emulate RCTs. We focus on key design elements of RCTs and how to emulate them with observational data. These elements include 1) eligibility criteria, 2) treatment assignment and randomisation, 3) specification of "time zero", 4) outcomes, 5) follow-up, 6) causal contrasts (intention-to-treat vs per-protocol), and 7) statistical analyses. In addition, we describe the design of an example target trial created to emulate the Trial to Assess Improvement in Therapeutic Outcomes by Optimizing Platelet Inhibition With Prasugrel Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TRITON-TIMI) 38 trial and compare effect estimates. Overall, careful design of a target trial using observational data can produce causal effect estimates that are often comparable to RCTs.},

   abstract = {Although the prevalence of malnutrition in the old age is increasing worldwide a synthetic understanding of the impact of aging on the intake, digestion, and absorption of nutrients is still lacking. This review article aims at filling the gap in knowledge between the functional decline of the aging gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and the consequences of malnutrition on the health status of elderly. Changes in the aging GIT include the mechanical disintegration of food, gastrointestinal motor function, food transit, chemical food digestion, and functionality of the intestinal wall. These alterations progressively decrease the ability of the GIT to provide the aging organism with adequate levels of nutrients, what contributes to the development of malnutrition. Malnutrition, in turn, increases the risks for the development of a range of pathologies associated with most organ systems, in particular the nervous-, muscoskeletal-, cardiovascular-, immune-, and skin systems. In addition to psychological, economics, and societal factors, dietary solutions preventing malnutrition should thus propose dietary guidelines and food products that integrate knowledge on the functionality of the aging GIT and the nutritional status of the elderly. Achieving this goal will request the identification, validation, and correlative analysis of biomarkers of food intake, nutrient bioavailability, and malnutrition.},

   abstract = {Without data from randomized trials, the long-term effects of fish consumption on coronary heart disease (CHD) need to be inferred from observational studies. We estimated CHD risk under different hypothetical interventions on fish consumption during mid- and later life in 2 prospective US cohorts of 25,797 men in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and 53,772 women in the Nurses' Health Study. Participants provided information on risk factors and disease every 2 years and on diet every 4 years. We adjusted for baseline and time-varying risk factors for CHD by using the parametric g-formula (where g stands for "generalized"). We observed 1,865 incident CHD cases among men (in 1990-2008) and 1,891 CHD cases among women (in 1986-2008). The risk ratios for CHD when comparing the risk if everyone had consumed at least 2 servings of fish per week with the risk if no one consumed fish during the follow-up periods were 1.03 (95% confidence interval: 0.90, 1.15) for men and 0.87 (95% confidence interval: 0.76, 0.98) for women. Our results suggest that increasing fish consumption to at least 2 servings per week in mid- or later life may lower CHD risk in women but not in men. Our analytical approach allowed us to explicitly specify hypothetical interventions and to assess the effectiveness of dietary changes in midlife.},

   abstract = {Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), a prominent tool for expressing assumptions in epidemiologic research, are most useful when the hypothetical data generating structure is correctly encoded. Understanding a study's data generating structure and translating that data structure into a DAG can be challenging, but these skills are often glossed over in training. Campbell and Stanley's framework for causal inference has been extraordinarily influential in social science training programs but has received less attention in epidemiology. Their work, along with subsequent revisions and enhancements based on practical experience conducting empirical studies, presents a catalog of 37 threats to validity describing reasons empirical studies may fail to deliver causal effects. We interpret most of these threats to study validity as suggestions for common causal structures. Threats are organized into issues of statistical conclusion validity, internal validity, construct validity, or external validity. To assist epidemiologists in drawing the correct DAG for their application, we map the correspondence between threats to validity and epidemiologic concepts that can be represented with DAGs. Representing these threats as DAGs makes them amenable to formal analysis with d-separation rules and breaks down cross-disciplinary language barriers in communicating methodologic issues.},

   abstract = {Inverse probability-weighted marginal structural models with binary exposures are common in epidemiology. Constructing inverse probability weights for a continuous exposure can be complicated by the presence of outliers, and the need to identify a parametric form for the exposure and account for nonconstant exposure variance. We explored the performance of various methods to construct inverse probability weights for continuous exposures using Monte Carlo simulation. We generated two continuous exposures and binary outcomes using data sampled from a large empirical cohort. The first exposure followed a normal distribution with homoscedastic variance. The second exposure followed a contaminated Poisson distribution, with heteroscedastic variance equal to the conditional mean. We assessed six methods to construct inverse probability weights using: a normal distribution, a normal distribution with heteroscedastic variance, a truncated normal distribution with heteroscedastic variance, a gamma distribution, a t distribution (1, 3, and 5 degrees of freedom), and a quantile binning approach (based on 10, 15, and 20 exposure categories). We estimated the marginal odds ratio for a single-unit increase in each simulated exposure in a regression model weighted by the inverse probability weights constructed using each approach, and then computed the bias and mean squared error for each method. For the homoscedastic exposure, the standard normal, gamma, and quantile binning approaches performed best. For the heteroscedastic exposure, the quantile binning, gamma, and heteroscedastic normal approaches performed best. Our results suggest that the quantile binning approach is a simple and versatile way to construct inverse probability weights for continuous exposures.},

This article presents the first population-level assessment of nutritional risk based on a large national sample representative of Canadian householders aged 65 or older. DATA SOURCES AND METHODS: Data from the 2008/2009 Canadian Community Health Survey-Healthy Aging were used to estimate the prevalence of nutritional risk by selected characteristics. Factors associated with nutritional risk were examined with restricted and full logistic models. The distribution of responses on the SCREEN II-AB nutritional risk instrument is reported. RESULTS: Based on the results of the 2008/2009 survey, 34% of Canadians aged 65 or older were at nutritional risk. Women were more likely than men to be at risk. Among people with depression, 62% were at nutritional risk, compared with 33% of people without depression. Level of disability, poor oral health, and medication use were associated with nutritional risk, as were living alone, low social support, infrequent social participation, and not driving on a regular basis. Lower income and education were also associated with nutritional risk. INTERPRETATION: Nutritional risk is common among seniors living in private households in Canada. The characteristics of people most likely to be at nutritional risk provide evidence for targeted screening and assessment.},

   abstract = {The formal approach in the field of causal inference has enabled epidemiologists to clarify several complications that arise when estimating the effect of an intervention on a health outcome of interest. When the outcome is a failure time or longitudinal process, researchers must often deal with competing events. In this issue of the Journal, Picciotto et al. (Am J Epidemiol. 2015;181(8):563-570) use structural nested failure time models to assess potential population effects of hypothetical interventions and censor competing events. In the present commentary, we discuss 2 interpretations that result from treating competing events as censored observations and how they relate to measures of public health impact. We also comment on 2 alternative approaches for handling competing events: an inverse probability weighting estimator of the survivor average causal effect and the parametric g-formula, which can be used to estimate a functional of the subdistribution of the event of interest. We argue that careful consideration of the tradeoff between the interpretation of the parameters from each approach and the assumptions required to estimate these parameters should guide researchers on the various ways to handle competing events in epidemiologic research.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the consistency of causal statements in observational studies published in The BMJ. DESIGN: Review of observational studies published in a general medical journal. DATA SOURCE: Cohort and other longitudinal studies describing an exposure-outcome relationship published in The BMJ in 2018. We also had access to the submitted papers and reviewer reports. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportion of published research papers with 'inconsistent' use of causal language. Papers where language was consistently causal or non-causal were classified as 'consistently causal' or 'consistently not causal', respectively. For the 'inconsistent' papers, we then compared the published and submitted version. RESULTS: Of 151 published research papers, 60 described eligible studies. Of these 60, we classified the causal language used as 'consistently causal' (48%), 'inconsistent' (20%) and 'consistently not causal'(32%). Eleven out of 12 (92%) of the 'inconsistent' papers were already inconsistent on submission. The inconsistencies found in both submitted and published versions were mainly due to mismatches between objectives and conclusions. One section might be carefully phrased in terms of association while the other presented causal language. When identifying only an association, some authors jumped to recommending acting on the findings as if motivated by the evidence presented. CONCLUSION: Further guidance is necessary for authors on what constitutes a causal statement and how to justify or discuss assumptions involved. Based on screening these papers, we provide a list of expressions beyond the obvious 'cause' word which may inspire a useful more comprehensive compendium on causal language.},

   journal = {medRxiv},
   pages = {2021.06.01.21258142},
   abstract = {Several of the hypothesized or studied exposures that may affect dementia risk are known to increase the risk of death. This may explain counterintuitive results, where exposures that are known to be harmful for mortality risk sometimes seem protective for the risk of dementia. Authors have attempted to explain these counterintuitive results as biased, but the bias associated with a particular analytic method cannot be defined or assessed if the causal question is not explicitly specified. Indeed, we can consider several causal questions when competing events like death, which cannot be prevented by design, are present. Current dementia research guidelines have not explicitly considered what constitutes a meaningful causal question in this setting or, more generally, how this choice justifies and should drive particular analytic decisions. To contextualize current practices, we first perform a systematic review of the conduct and interpretation of longitudinal studies focused on dementia outcomes where death is a competing event. We then describe and demonstrate how to address different causal questions (referred here as “the total effect” and “the controlled direct effect”) with traditional analytic approaches under explicit assumptions. Our application focuses on smoking cessation in late-midlife. To illustrate core concepts, we discuss this example both in terms of a hypothetical randomized trial and with an emulation of such a trial using observational data from the Rotterdam Study.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis study was partly funded by ZonMW Memorabel (projectnr 73305095005) and Alzheimer Nederland through the Netherlands Consortium of Dementia Cohorts (NCDC) in the context of Deltaplan Dementie.Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:The Rotterdam Study has been approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Erasmus MC (registration number MEC 02.1015) and by the Dutch Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sport (Population Screening Act WBO, license number 1071272-159521-PG).

   abstract = {Methods based on propensity score (PS) have become increasingly popular as a tool for causal inference. A better understanding of the relative advantages and disadvantages of the alternative analytic approaches can contribute to the optimal choice and use of a specific PS method over other methods. In this article, we provide an accessible overview of causal inference from observational data and two major PS-based methods (matching and inverse probability weighting), focusing on the underlying assumptions and decision-making processes. We then discuss common pitfalls and tips for applying the PS methods to empirical research and compare the conventional multivariable outcome regression and the two alternative PS-based methods (ie, matching and inverse probability weighting) and discuss their similarities and differences. Although we note subtle differences in causal identification assumptions, we highlight that the methods are distinct primarily in terms of the statistical modeling assumptions involved and the target population for which exposure effects are being estimated.},

   abstract = {Mendelian randomization (MR) studies are often described as naturally occurring randomized trials in which genetic factors are randomly assigned by nature. Conceptualizing MR studies as randomized trials has profound implications for their design, conduct, reporting, and interpretation. For example, analytic practices that are discouraged in randomized trials should also be discouraged in MR studies. Here, we deconstruct the oft-made analogy between MR and randomized trials. We describe four key threats to the analogy between MR studies and randomized trials: (1) exchangeability is not guaranteed; (2) time zero (and therefore the time for setting eligibility criteria) is unclear; (3) the treatment assignment is often measured with error; and (4) adherence is poorly defined. By precisely defining the causal effects being estimated, we underscore that MR estimates are often vaguely analogous to per-protocol effects in randomized trials, and that current MR methods for estimating analogues of per-protocol effects could be biased in practice. We conclude that the analogy between randomized trials and MR studies provides further perspective on both the strengths and the limitations of MR studies as currently implemented, as well as future directions for MR methodology development and application. In particular, the analogy highlights potential future directions for some MR studies to produce more interpretable and informative numerical estimates.},

   abstract = {A review of epidemiological papers conducted in 2009 concluded that several studies employed variable selection methods susceptible to introduce bias and yield inadequate inferences. Many new confounder selection methods have been developed since then. The goal of the study was to provide an updated descriptive portrait of which variable selection methods are used by epidemiologists for analyzing observational data. Studies published in four major epidemiological journals in 2015 were reviewed. Only articles concerned with a predictive or explicative objective and reporting on the analysis of individual data were included. Method(s) employed for selecting variables were extracted from retained articles. A total of 975 articles were retrieved and 299 met eligibility criteria, 292 of which pursued an explicative objective. Among those, 146 studies (50%) reported using prior knowledge or causal graphs for selecting variables, 34 (12%) used change in effect estimate methods, 26 (9%) used stepwise approaches, 16 (5%) employed univariate analyses, 5 (2%) used various other methods and 107 (37%) did not provide sufficient details to allow classification (more than one method could be employed in a single article). Despite being less frequent than in the previous review, stepwise and univariable analyses, which are susceptible to introduce bias and produce inadequate inferences, were still prevalent. Moreover, 37% studies did not provide sufficient details to assess how variables were selected. We thus believe there is still room for improvement in variable selection methods used by epidemiologists and in their reporting.},

   abstract = {Estimating the population risk of disease under hypothetical interventions--such as the population risk of coronary heart disease (CHD) were everyone to quit smoking and start exercising or to start exercising if diagnosed with diabetes--may not be possible using standard analytic techniques. The parametric g-formula, which appropriately adjusts for time-varying confounders affected by prior exposures, is especially well suited to estimating effects when the intervention involves multiple factors (joint interventions) or when the intervention involves decisions that depend on the value of evolving time-dependent factors (dynamic interventions). We describe the parametric g-formula, and use it to estimate the effect of various hypothetical lifestyle interventions on the risk of CHD using data from the Nurses' Health Study. Over the period 1982-2002, the 20-year risk of CHD in this cohort was 3.50%. Under a joint intervention of no smoking, increased exercise, improved diet, moderate alcohol consumption and reduced body mass index, the estimated risk was 1.89% (95% confidence interval: 1.46-2.41). We discuss whether the assumptions required for the validity of the parametric g-formula hold in the Nurses' Health Study data. This work represents the first large-scale application of the parametric g-formula in an epidemiologic cohort study.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an increasingly popular approach for identifying confounding variables that require conditioning when estimating causal effects. This review examined the use of DAGs in applied health research to inform recommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research. METHODS: Original health research articles published during 1999-2017 mentioning 'directed acyclic graphs' (or similar) or citing DAGitty were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline and Embase. Data were extracted on the reporting of: estimands, DAGs and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article's largest DAG. RESULTS: A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using DAGs. A fifth (n = 48, 21%) reported their target estimand(s) and half (n = 115, 48%) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their DAG(s). Two-thirds of the articles (n = 144, 62%) made at least one DAG available. DAGs varied in size but averaged 12 nodes [interquartile range (IQR): 9-16, range: 3-28] and 29 arcs (IQR: 19-42, range: 3-99). The median saturation (i.e. percentage of total possible arcs) was 46% (IQR: 31-67, range: 12-100). 37% (n = 53) of the DAGs included unobserved variables, 17% (n = 25) included 'super-nodes' (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable) and 34% (n = 49) were visually arranged so that the constituent arcs flowed in the same direction (e.g. top-to-bottom). CONCLUSION: There is substantial variation in the use and reporting of DAGs in applied health research. Although this partly reflects their flexibility, it also highlights some potential areas for improvement. This review hence offers several recommendations to improve the reporting and use of DAGs in future research.},

   abstract = {Selecting an appropriate set of confounders for which to control is critical for reliable causal inference. Recent theoretical and methodological developments have helped clarify a number of principles of confounder selection. When complete knowledge of a causal diagram relating all covariates to each other is available, graphical rules can be used to make decisions about covariate control. Unfortunately, such complete knowledge is often unavailable. This paper puts forward a practical approach to confounder selection decisions when the somewhat less stringent assumption is made that knowledge is available for each covariate whether it is a cause of the exposure, and whether it is a cause of the outcome. Based on recent theoretically justified developments in the causal inference literature, the following proposal is made for covariate control decisions: control for each covariate that is a cause of the exposure, or of the outcome, or of both; exclude from this set any variable known to be an instrumental variable; and include as a covariate any proxy for an unmeasured variable that is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome. Various principles of confounder selection are then further related to statistical covariate selection methods.},

   abstract = {In failure-time settings, a competing event is any event that makes it impossible for the event of interest to occur. For example, cardiovascular disease death is a competing event for prostate cancer death because an individual cannot die of prostate cancer once he has died of cardiovascular disease. Various statistical estimands have been defined as possible targets of inference in the classical competing risks literature. Many reviews have described these statistical estimands and their estimating procedures with recommendations about their use. However, this previous work has not used a formal framework for characterizing causal effects and their identifying conditions, which makes it difficult to interpret effect estimates and assess recommendations regarding analytic choices. Here we use a counterfactual framework to explicitly define each of these classical estimands. We clarify that, depending on whether competing events are defined as censoring events, contrasts of risks can define a total effect of the treatment on the event of interest or a direct effect of the treatment on the event of interest not mediated by the competing event. In contrast, regardless of whether competing events are defined as censoring events, counterfactual hazard contrasts cannot generally be interpreted as causal effects. We illustrate how identifying assumptions for all of these counterfactual estimands can be represented in causal diagrams, in which competing events are depicted as time-varying covariates. We present an application of these ideas to data from a randomized trial designed to estimate the effect of estrogen therapy on prostate cancer mortality.},

A 73-item, semiquantitative, self-administered food frequency questionnaire (FFQ), was adapted in French and English from the Block National Cancer Institute Health Habits and History Questionnaire. The FFQ was used to capture usual long-term food consumption among adults living in Quebec. A representative sample of adults aged 18 to 82 (57% female) was recruited by random digit dialling in the Montreal region. Approximately 64% of recruits completed and returned the instrument by mail (n=248). The FFQ was validated in a subsample (n=94, 61% female) using four nonconsecutive food records (FRs). Median energy intakes (in kcal) for men and women, respectively, were FFQ (total sample) 2,112 and 1,823, FFQ (subsample) 2,137 and 1,752, and FR (subsample) 2,510 and 1,830. Spearman correlation analyses between FFQ and FR nutrients were positive (with r ranging from 0.32 for folate to 0.58 for saturated fatty acids) and statistically significant (p<0.001), with better results among women. On average, cross-classification of energy and 24 nutrients from the FFQ and means of four FRs placed 39% into identical quartiles and 78% into identical and contiguous quartiles, with only 4% frankly misclassified. These results suggest that the FFQ is a relatively valid instrument for determining usual diet in Quebec adults.},

   pages = {1393-1512},
   abstract = {In observational cohort mortality studies with prolonged periods of exposure to the agent under study, it is not uncommon for risk factors for death to be determinants of subsequent exposure. For instance, in occupational mortality studies date of termination of employment is both a determinant of future exposure (since terminated individuals receive no further exposure) and an independent risk factor for death (since disabled individuals tend to leave employment). When current risk factor status determines subsequent exposure and is determined by previous exposure, standard analyses that estimate age-specific mortality rates as a function of cumulative exposure may underestimate the true effect of exposure on mortality whether or not one adjusts for the risk factor in the analysis. This observation raises the question, which if any population parameters can be given a causal interpretation in observational mortality studies? In answer, we offer a graphical approach to the identification and computation of causal parameters in mortality studies with sustained exposure periods. This approach is shown to be equivalent to an approach in which the observational study is identified with a hypothetical double-blind randomized trial in which data on each subject's assigned treatment protocol has been erased from the data file. Causal inferences can then be made by comparing mortality as a function of treatment protocol, since, in a double-blind randomized trial missing data on treatment protocol, the association of mortality with treatment protocol can still be estimated. We reanalyze the mortality experience of a cohort of arsenic-exposed copper smelter workers with our method and compare our results with those obtained using standard methods. We find an adverse effect of arsenic exposure on all-cause and lung cancer mortality which standard methods fail to detect.},

   abstract = {We assessed the validity of the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) in a sample of sedentary adults (56 men, 134 women, mean age +/- [SD] 66.5+/-5.3 years) who volunteered to participate in a randomized controlled trial on the effect of aerobic conditioning on psychological function. Construct validity was established by correlating PASE scores with physiologic and performance characteristics: peak oxygen uptake, resting heart rate and blood pressure, percent body fat, and balance. The mean PASE scores were higher in men than in women (men = 145.8+/-78.0; women = 123.9+/-66.3, P<0.05), and in those age 55-64 years compared with those age 65 years and over (55-64 = 144.2+/-75.8; 65 and over = 118.9+/-63.9, P<0.05). PASE scores were also significantly higher in those who did not report a chronic health condition (cardiovascular disease, hypertension, cancer, or recent surgery). PASE scores were significantly associated (P<0.05) with peak oxygen uptake (r = 0.20), systolic blood pressure (r = -0.18) and balance score (r = 0.20). No significant associations of PASE score and diastolic blood pressure, resting heart rate, or percent body fat were noted. These results provide additional evidence for the validity of the PASE as a measure of physical activity suitable for use in epidemiology studies on the association of physical activity, health, and physical function in older individuals.},

   abstract = {A Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) was evaluated in a sample of community-dwelling, older adults. Respondents were randomly assigned to complete the PASE by mail or telephone before or after a home visit assessment. Item weights for the PASE were derived by regressing a physical activity principal component score on responses to the PASE. The component score was based on 3-day motion sensor counts, a 3-day physical activity dairy and a global activity self-assessment. Test-retest reliability, assessed over a 3-7 week interval, was 0.75 (95% CI = 0.69-0.80). Reliability for mail administration (r = 0.84) was higher than for telephone administration (r = 0.68). Construct validity was established by correlating PASE scores with health status and physiologic measures. As hypothesized, PASE scores were positively associated with grip strength (r = 0.37), static balance (r = +0.33), leg strength (r = 0.25) and negatively correlated with resting heart rate (r = -0.13), age (r = -0.34) and perceived health status (r = -0.34); and overall Sickness Impact Profile score (r = -0.42). The PASE is a brief, easily scored, reliable and valid instrument for the assessment of physical activity in epidemiologic studies of older people.},
